<div align="justify">
Ph.D. candidate in [Computing Science](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca) at the [University of Alberta](http://www.ualberta.ca), researching example-driven data wrangling. Specifically, I study how to automate wrangling tasks such as data transformation and missing data imputation using a zoom-in/zoom-out approach: zooming in on a few informative examples that hold enough information for the task, and zooming out to generalize and apply the learned patterns across the data.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
